Racism is one of many social issues that has resurfaced since Donald J. Trump became president. Many of his detractors accuse him of being a racist. Is Trump one? Did America elect a racist president?

To answer this question, we must first define racism. Merriam-Webster defines racism as:

> A belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.

Oxford defines racism as:

> Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

According to both sources, racism requires the belief of inherent racial superiority. Thus, it is much harder for minorities, especially ones who have been subjected to oppression, to be racist. Furthermore, these definitions are much narrower definitions than the ones common flung around in the political shouting ring. One can hate all other races, hold biases against all other races, and still fall short of the racism threshold.

Based on his background, actions, and statements, I am very skeptical that the sitting president would believe Caucasian whites to be inherently superior. Thus, it is extremely unlikely that Trump is a racist, although you can certainly call him one.
